# Workout App - Storm Lifts

A workout app that lets you create exercises, build workouts, and run them through a built-in timer.
It automatically tracks your current exercise so you never have to remember what comes next.

This project was created to practise and demonstrate front-end development skills — including React, TypeScript, accessibility, testing, and responsive design.

- **Fully responsive design** optimised for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

- **State management** to persist exercises and workouts while you use the app.

- **Comprehensive testing** using modern front-end testing tools.

- **Built with React + TypeScript** following best practices and clean code principles.
